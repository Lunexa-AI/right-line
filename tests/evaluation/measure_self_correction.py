"""
ARCH-058: Self-Correction Effectiveness Measurement

This script evaluates the effectiveness of the self-correction system by:
- Measuring trigger rates for different query complexities
- Comparing quality before and after self-correction
- Analyzing refinement vs retrieval paths
- Documenting latency impact
- Calculating quality improvement metrics

Usage:
    python tests/evaluation/measure_self_correction.py
    
Or with custom parameters:
    python tests/evaluation/measure_self_correction.py --queries 50 --complexity complex
