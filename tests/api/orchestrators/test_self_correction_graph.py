Tests for ARCH-054 and ARCH-055: Self-Correction Graph Routing

Tests the LangGraph self-correction system including:
- Conditional routing based on quality results
- Self-correction loops (refine_synthesis path)
- Iterative retrieval loops (retrieve_more path)
- Iteration limits (max 2 iterations)
- Graph compilation and execution
