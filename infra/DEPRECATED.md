# DEPRECATED: Infrastructure as Code

⚠️ **This directory is deprecated in favor of managed services.**

The infrastructure-as-code approach (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) has been replaced with managed serverless services:

- **Vercel** - Serverless functions and static hosting
- **Milvus Cloud** - Managed vector database
- **OpenAI** - AI/ML services
- **Vercel KV** - Key-value storage for analytics

## 🚀 New Architecture

The new serverless architecture eliminates the need for:
- ❌ Docker containers and orchestration
- ❌ Kubernetes clusters
- ❌ Terraform infrastructure provisioning
- ❌ VPS/server management
- ❌ Database administration

Instead, we use:
- ✅ Vercel Functions (auto-scaling)
- ✅ Managed cloud services
- ✅ Pay-per-use pricing
- ✅ Zero infrastructure maintenance

## 📦 Migration

See the new deployment approach:
- [**MVP Architecture**](../docs/project/MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [**Deployment Guide**](../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [**Migration Notes**](../MIGRATION_NOTES.md)

*This directory is kept for reference only. All new deployments should use the serverless approach.*
